In that respect, previous research mainly focused on energy management of individual buildings. In contrast, in this paper, we focus on aggregated control of a set of residential buildings, to provide grid supporting services, that eventually should include ancillary services. In particular, we present a real-life pilot study that studies the effectiveness of reinforcement-learning (RL) in coordinating the power consumption of 8 residential buildings to jointly track a target power signal. Our RL approach relies solely on observed data from individual households and does not require any explicit building models or simulators, making it practical to implement and easy to scale. We show the feasibility of our proposed RL-based coordination strategy in a real-world setting. In a 4-week case study, we demonstrate a hierarchical control system, relying on an RL-based ranking system to select which households to activate flex assets from, and a real-time PI control-based power dispatch mechanism to control the selected assets. Our results demonstrate satisfactory power tracking, and the effectiveness of the RL-based ranks which are learnt in a purely data-driven manner.","tags":["Reinforcement Learning","Advantage function","Building Cluster","Coordination","Demand Response"],"title":"Real-World Implementation of Reinforcement Learning Based Energy Coordination for a Cluster of Households","type":"publication"},{"authors":["C.

Proposing efficient bidding strategies for simultaneous participation in the energy and reserve market is challenging since it requires the integration of different market mechanisms in a single optimization problem (combining energy and reserve markets), as well as an accurate mathematical model of industrial processes from which to obtain energy flexibility. Often, such mathematical models are either not available or are described through complex simulators, making the design of a computationally efficient bidding strategy a complicated task. This paper introduces a novel framework to support energy-intensive industrial plants to offer energy flexibility in the joint energy and reserve market. We use a neural network to model the complex nonlinear dynamics of the industrial flexible process. Then, to reduce the complexity of the resulting optimization process we convert the neural network into linear constraints, formulating the problem of bidding energy flexibility into the electricity market as a mixed-integer linear program. The uncertainties of the process variables are considered using a scenario-based approach. A realistic simulation considering the case of an evaporative cooling tower used in the chemical industry, participating in the Belgian electricity market is carried out to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed scheme.","tags":["Electricity markets","Demand response","Energy flexibility","Neural networks","Recurrent Neural Networks","Deep Learning","Mixed-integer-linear programming"],"title":"A data-driven optimization framework for industrial demand-side flexibility","type":"publication"},{"authors":["M.

Such flexibility refers to a system's ability to deviate from its scheduled energy consumption.  Identifying the flexibility, and therefore, designing control that ensures efficient and reliable operation presents a great challenge due to the inherently complex dynamics of industrial systems. Recently, machine learning models have attracted attention for identifying flexibility, due to their ability to model complex nonlinear behavior. This research presents machine learning based methods that integrate system dynamics into the machine learning models (eg Neural Networks) for better adherence to physical constraints. We define and evaluate physics informed long-short term memory networks PyLSTM and physics informed neural networks PyNN for the identification of flexibility in the evaporative cooling process. These physics informed networks approximate the time-dependent relationship between control input and system response while enforcing the dynamics of the process in the neural network architecture. Our proposed PyLSTM provides less than 2% system response estimation error, converges in less than half iterations compared to a baseline Neural Network NN, and accurately estimates the defined flexibility metrics. We include a detailed analysis of the impact of training data size on the performance and optimization of our proposed models.","tags":["Deep Learning","Evaporative Cooling Tower","Flexibility","PhyLSTM","PhyNN","Recurrent Neural Networks","Physics Based Machine Learning"],"title":"Physics Informed LSTM Network for Flexibility Identification in Evaporative Cooling Systems","type":"publication"},{"authors":["K.

System identification of such energy buffers demands proper estimation/prediction of their physical quantities and unknown parameters.

This paper proposes physics-informed neural networks-based grey-box modeling methods for the identification of energy buffers. The underlying system dynamics are enforced on the neural network structure to ensure that the identified grey-box model follows the approximate physics. We define two novel grey-box models based on simple and recurrent neural network architectures and test these models for a generic energy buffer. Performance and training time for the proposed grey-box models are compared against a black-box baseline model.

Their increased penetration introduces both challenges and opportunities; they contribute to increased load, but also offer flexibility potential, e.g., in deferring the load in time. To analyze such scenarios, realistic EV data are required, which are hard to come by. Therefore, in this article we define a synthetic data generator (SDG) for EV charging sessions based on a large real-world dataset. Arrival times of EVs are modeled assuming that the inter-arrival times of EVs follow an exponential distribution. Connection time for EVs is dependent on the arrival time of EV, and can be described using a conditional probability distribution. This distribution is estimated using Gaussian mixture models, and departure times can calculated by sampling connection times for EV arrivals from this distribution. Our SDG is based on a novel method for the temporal modeling of EV sessions, and jointly models the arrival and departure times of EVs for a large number of charging stations. Our SDG was trained using real-world EV sessions, and used to generate synthetic samples of session data, which were statistically indistinguishable from the real-world data. We provide both (i) source code to train SDG models from new data, and (ii) trained models that reflect real-world datasets.","tags":["smart grid","electric vehicle","synthetic data","exponential distribution","Poisson distribution","Gaussian mixture models","mathematical modeling","machine learning","simulation"],"title":"Synthetic Data Generator for Electric Vehicle Charging Sessions: Modeling and Evaluation Using Real-World Data","type":"publication"},{"authors":["M.

Boron possesses the second greatest heating value of any element that can be adopted as an energetic material in the processing of propellants and explosives. In the present work, boron-based composite solid propellants are examined theoretically. In the actual condition, boron has problems during the ignition and combustion due to the coating of B2O3 layer on its surface. The vacuum-specific impulse and the specific impulse are calculated for several boron-based propellants with the help of NASA Lewis Code, Chemical Equilibrium with Applications (CEA). Several other elements such as aluminium, iron, magnesium and titanium are also considered in this study as additives in boron-based propellants. The performance values of boron-based propellants are compared with that of pure aluminium-based composite propellant. In the CEA simulation hydroxyl terminated polybutadiene (HTPB) and ammonium perchlorate (AP) are taken as binder and oxidizer, respectively. Although pure boron-HTPB-AP has the highest theoretical performance, it is observed that presence of any small percentage of boron in aluminized propellant can give higher performance than that of pure aluminium-based propellant.","tags":["Rocket Propulsion","Propellant ingredients","Boron combustion","Specific impulse","NASA CEA thermodynamic simulation"],"title":"Calculation of Theoretical Performance of Boron-Based Composite Solid Propellant for the Future Applications.","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Department of Aerospace Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur, India.\n“Experimental screening of boron based solid rocket fuels for hybrid rocket applications”\nPresented also at - 11th International High Energy Material Conference and Exhibits, 2017.\nWorked on construction of an opposed flow burner and tested multiple propellant pallet compositions to study Isp and velocity dynamics.\nAnalysed 120 nano boron compositions, calculated effect of particle size on burn rates, particle trajectory \u0026amp; specific impulse.
